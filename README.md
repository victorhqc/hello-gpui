## Bootleg Calculator

<img src="./screenshots/bootleg-calculator.png" height="350" />

Apple's Calculator bootleg copy. It works somewhat ok, but of course not really
production ready. However, it does the following:

1. Calculation of Addition, Subtraction, Division and Multiplication.
2. Shows previous operation.
3. Keyboard shortcuts.
4. Buttons illuminate on key press.
